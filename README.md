# Portfolio
This is a portfolio and that's it, basically. A bit wordy, but that's what people expect from a portfolio, right?

If you want to take a look, you can find it [HERE](https://jlannoo.dev).

If you want to know more you can check the code.

It's made in React, if you care. Should probably migrate it to Astro or something.
